# XANES-Wizard
Current version of the XANES-Wizard Matlab App

Matlab App for handling hyperspectral image data, mainly, but not only, for XANES image data, that is, X-ray transmission image data collected using the Xradia TXM system.
I am constantly updating the code to implement other file formats and functionalities as well - suggestions are welcome.

Required toolboxes in Matlab to run the app:
'Optimization Toolbox'
'Image Processing Toolbox'
'Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox'
'Parallel Computing Toolbox'
